I'm **Seunghyuk Lee**. If it's hard to pronounce, you can call me **Hayden**. 

My major is **Information Security**, but I prefer to develop something than hack some stuff. 

I enjoy coding. My primary language is **Python** and **Java** as auxiliary. Especially interested in **deep learning**, **Data Science**, and **Cryptography** nowadays(This keeps changing).
